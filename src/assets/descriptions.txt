HEART OF CEBU

In this plate, we were tasked to use alcohol markers as our medium. It was my first time using them, and I was having a hard time mastering the blending, layering, and control required to create smooth transitions. Despite the challenge, the process taught me how to work patiently with the medium and experiment with different techniques such as hatching and scribbling, which I incorporated into the overall rendering. The artwork features the Sugbo Chinese Heritage Museum, illustrated with expressive colors and bold strokes to highlight its architectural character. Through this plate, I learned not only how to handle alcohol markers but also how to translate architectural forms into a vibrant, dynamic visual representation.

LINE DRAWING

In this plate, we have the freedom to create any line drawing. I chose to illustrate a stylized chess knight, using intricate patterns and repetitive line work to give the subject depth, texture, and movement. The background and foreground are filled with different line-based motifs—such as waves, spirals, and geometric shapes—to create contrast and highlight the details of the central figure. This activity allowed me to explore how simple lines can form complex visual effects, teaching me patience, precision, and creativity in composing a unified artwork. Through this exercise, I learned how lines alone can communicate rhythm, form, and personality without relying on color or shading.

9 - SCALE TONAL VALUES

This plate demonstrates a 9-scale tonal value using four different shading techniques: hatching, cross-hatching, scribbling, and stippling. Each technique transitions from light to dark by gradually increasing the density and layering of lines, marks, or dots. In the hatching scale, the values progress by adding more parallel lines and decreasing the spaces between them. The cross-hatching section builds tone through intersecting lines that become denser in each box, creating richer and darker values. The scribbling scale uses overlapping loops and irregular strokes that grow tighter and heavier to achieve deeper shades. Lastly, the stippling scale shifts from light to dark through the controlled placement of dots—starting with sparse points and becoming densely packed in the darkest values. These four techniques show how varying mark density and repetition can create a complete tonal range from very light to solid dark.

SHADOWS OF A PLAIN FORM ON  A VERTICAL WALL

This plate demonstrates the projection of shadows cast by a plain form onto a vertical wall using precise construction lines and geometric analysis. The primary object, shown with curved and angular surfaces, is illuminated from an oblique light source, indicated by the diagonal light ray. Vertical and horizontal projection lines are used to track how the edges and curves of the form extend toward the wall, creating an accurate shadow outline. The resulting shadow is carefully constructed by transferring key points of the form onto the wall plane, ensuring correct alignment and proportion. Hatched areas highlight the shaded regions, while clear dimensional markings and guidelines maintain technical accuracy. The drawing shows how light interacts with basic forms and how shadows can be systematically projected onto vertical surfaces in architectural drafting.


PERSPECTIVE DRAWING: ARCHITECTS METHOD

This plate demonstrates the architect’s method in perspective drawing, where a two-point perspective is constructed using precise reference lines and vanishing points. The drawing begins with the establishment of the picture plane (PP), ground line (GL), and horizon line (HL), followed by locating the station point (SP) to determine the viewer’s position. From the SP, projectors extend toward the left and right vanishing points (VPL and VPR), guiding the accurate convergence of lines that form the structure. The mass of the house is built using measuring points and projection lines to ensure proportional scaling in depth, height, and width. Red outlines highlight the edges of the final form, while underlying construction lines show the systematic process of defining volumes in proper perspective. This method ensures that the architectural form appears visually realistic and correctly oriented within the viewer’s field of vision.

A PROPOSED COFFEE SHOP

This proposed 3×6-meter coffee shop near Cebu’s Tops is designed to create a warm, stylish retreat that blends rustic charm with modern sophistication. Featuring natural stone textures, wooden-like accents, and extensive tempered glass walls, the structure offers unobstructed scenic views while harmonizing with its surrounding environment. The building is supported by a reinforced concrete foundation with steel beams, wood framing, and gabion walls, complemented by a clay-tile roofing system. Exterior works include applying a warm #E2D7A7 paint finish, sealing glass panels, and completing the clay-tile roof, while the interior features matte porcelain wood-look flooring, terrazzo wall tiles, and wood or laminate countertops. Site preparation consists of clearing, excavation, and grading to ensure a stable base for construction. Overall, the design aims to deliver a comfortable, contemporary, and nature-integrated coffee experience.


TAGBO

“Tagbo” is a food village whose architectural concept is inspired by the form and dynamics of a paper plane. The design emphasizes lightness, direction, and openness, expressed through angular rooflines, overlapping planes, and airy structural frameworks that guide movement throughout the space. Wide spans and open layouts encourage natural ventilation, while strategic orientation maximizes daylight and creates a welcoming environment for communal dining. The folded, layered forms of the structure reflect the folds of a paper plane, symbolizing both simplicity and ingenuity in design. By combining functional circulation, climate-responsive strategies, and a playful yet purposeful form, “Tagbo” becomes not only a hub for food and community but also a contemporary architectural statement rooted in clarity, flow, and connection.

The structure exhibits a symmetrical V-shaped plan with two slanted roof planes that rise outward, resembling an arrowhead or wings. This dynamic form gives the building a sense of motion and lightness. The sharp central ridge at the top enhances its angular and aerodynamic profile. The butterfly roof configuration slopes upward from the center towards both ends, creating a visually striking silhouette. The extended eaves emphasize horizontal lines while providing shading to the glazed walls below. The building’s facade is characterized by a continuous grid of vertical and horizontal wooden mullions that frame expansive glass panels. This pattern establishes rhythm and repetition, giving balance to the bold geometry of the roof.

The structure features a symmetrical diamond-shaped plan with slanted roofs rising outward like paper plane wings, creating a sense of motion and lightness.
